# Resources for Technical Writers in General and API Writers in Particular

## Web Resources

[I'd rather be writing](http://www.idratherbewriting.com) Tom Johnson's blog about technical writing is always useful.

## Classes and Certifications

[Tom Johnson's API writing course](https://idratherbewriting.com/category-api-doc/)
Covers the hands-on tasks like using Postman to test your code samples.

[Peter Gruenbaum's class on API documentation](https://www.udemy.com/user/petergruenbaum/)
Peter's classes cover the basic concepts really well. I'd recommend that beginners take these courses and then proceed through Tom Johnson's API course.
